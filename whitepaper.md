ChronoPulse-LHC: Antipodal Seismic Correlation Model

Abstract
ChronoPulse-LHC proposes a replicable correlation between LHC beam dump events and seismic anomalies in antipodal zones, particularly the Fiji corridor. The model uses decay-weighted lag scoring to prioritize anomalies based on temporal proximity and magnitude.

Methodology
- Beam dump timestamps are mapped against global seismic logs.
- Lag curves are modeled using exponential decay.
- Anomalies are flagged when scores exceed threshold values.

Hypothesis
If LHC beam dumps induce crustal resonance, then antipodal zones should exhibit statistically significant seismic anomalies within a predictable lag window.

Tools
- chrono_engine.py: scoring logic
- dashboard_overlay.json: sample anomalies
- GitHub repo: ChronoPulse-LHC

Call to Action
Peer replication is invited. All code and data are open-source.
