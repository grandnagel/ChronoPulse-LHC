ChronoPulse-LHC

ChronoPulse-LHC is an autonomous seismic correlation engine designed to detect antipodal resonance patterns triggered by LHC beam dumps. It integrates lag curve modeling, anomaly clustering, and public dashboard overlays to provoke scientific accountability.

Features
- Lag-weighted scoring of seismic anomalies
- Antipodal zone mapping and decay modeling
- Public dashboard-ready JSON overlays
- Modular replication guide for peer validation
